# Model Content Based Filtering

Content-based filtering is a recommendation system technique that suggests items to users based on the attributes of items they previously expressed interest in. In this model, several features are used to create a more complex recommendation system, incorporating attributes such as vehicle type, vehicle brand, and vehicle color.

## Mean Squared Error (MSE)

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a measure of the quality of an estimatorâ€”it is always non-negative, and values closer to zero are better. It represents the average of the squares of the errors, indicating the difference between the estimator and what is estimated.

Below are the MSE graphs showing the performance of our model:

The first graph represents the MSE over the training epochs, showing how the model's performance improves over time.

The second image displays the latest MSE values for both training and validation sets.

**Latest MSE Values:**
- **Training MSE:** 0.0013
- **Validation MSE:** 0.0051

These values illustrate the model's accuracy during training and validation phases, helping us understand its performance and reliability.
